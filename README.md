# HR-Churn-Analysis

K-Means Clustering Project:

This project uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to group employees based on their job satisfaction and average monthly hours worked.

Requirements

1.Python 3.7 or above

2.Pandas

3.Numpy

4.Matplotlib

5.Sklearn

Getting Started

. Clone or download this repository to your local machine

. Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt

. Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor

. Run the file k_means_clustering.py to see the results

Results

The algorithm will produce a plot that shows the number of clusters versus the within-cluster sum of squares. This plot can be used to determine the optimal number of clusters for the data. The final result will be a scatter plot showing the grouped employees based on their job satisfaction and average monthly hours worked.

Limitations

1.The results of the clustering algorithm are highly dependent on the initial placement of the centroids.

2.The algorithm assumes that the variance of the different features is spherical, which may not always be the case in real-world data.
  Conclusion
  
3.K-Means clustering is a simple and effective way to group similar data points based on multiple features. However, it is important to carefully evaluate the results   and consider the limitations of the algorithm.
